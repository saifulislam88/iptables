## **Interview Question**

### **ðŸ’¡Q.** Why does iptables need both INPUT and OUTPUT rules to allow a specific service or port simultaneously between the local server and a remote IP?

**Yes, both rules are needed** if you want to allow SNMP communication (both requests and responses) between your server and the remote IP **20x.4x.3x.5x**

**ðŸ“ŒThe INPUT rule allows** SNMP requests from the remote host to reach your server.\
**ðŸ“ŒThe OUTPUT rule allows** your server to respond or send SNMP traps to the remote host.

**Without one of these rules** the communication would be incomplete:\
**ðŸ“ŒIf the INPUT rule is missing,** SNMP requests from the remote host would be blocked.\
**ðŸ“ŒIf the OUTPUT rule is missing,** SNMP responses or traps from your server would not reach the remote host.

**Therefore, both input and output rules are necessary for full bidirectional SNMP communication with the specified IP address.**

```sh
iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -o eno1np0 --sport 161 -d 20x.4x.3x.5x/32 --dport 1024:65535 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p udp -i eno1np0 -s 20x.4x.3x.5x/32 --sport 1024:65535 --dport 161 -j ACCEPT
```
